%description
This is the opencrowbar-core package for Crowbar 2.0. A typical deployment will require this
package and at least one workload deployer package such as: crowbar-openstack,
crowbar-hadoop, crowbar-ceph, etc.

Crowbar 2.0 is a second-generation DevOps tool that enables deployment of bare servers
into a production ready cluster in a matter of hours.  Crowbar 2.0 can deploy any software
stack, but has been initially developed to deploy Hadoop and OpenStack.

Crowbar 2.0 is able to prepare server hardware, firmware, and hardware-based controllers
to create a known-state hardware platform that is ready to receive the installation of
an operating system, application-specific software, pre-configure the application-specific
platform so it is ready to deploy a clustered workload to compute and/or storage nodes.

Crowbar provides server discovery, firmware updates, and operating system installation 
using PXE boot or virtual instance deployment.  Crowbar deploys applications on top of
hardware-provisioned operating system platforms using Jigs.  Supported Jigs includes:
Chef, Puppet, and SSH-based shell scripting.
